# Summary: 
There are 41% of 5 star reviews are paid and 29% of 5 stars products are unpaid. It means more customers choose products of $ellby company. Therefore, we donâ€™t need any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. But I would recommend they could do the frequency analyze like how often that the customers use their products based on the reviews.
